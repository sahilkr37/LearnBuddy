# LearnBuddy 🎓  
### Match, Learn & Grow Together  

**LearnBuddy** is a **Skill & Mentor Match Platform** inspired by Tinder but designed for learning, collaboration, and networking.  

With a simple swipe-based interface, users can create a profile with:  
- Basic details (name, role, branch/profession)  
- **Skills they know**  
- **Skills they want to learn**  

The platform works in two modes:  
1. **Skill Swap Mode** 🔄 – Match with people whose skills complement yours.  
   - Example: You know Python but want to learn Guitar → You match with someone who knows Guitar but wants to learn Python.  
2. **Same Tech Mode** 🤝 – Connect with people from the same domain.  
   - Example: A BTech junior in CSE can find a senior, or two React developers can collaborate.  

When two users swipe right on each other, a connection is formed, enabling chat and collaboration.  

### 🌟 Why LearnBuddy?  
- Peer-to-peer **skill exchange**  
- **Student–senior mentorship**  
- **Professional networking**  
- Fun, engaging, and productive — all in a Tinder-like interface!
